entity A7_Mux; is
  Port(C_SEL: in std_logic_vector(5 downto 0);--creates 6 bits that make the channel select sigals. The Pi will control these.
       COL: in std_logic_vector(0 to 36);--creates the 37 channels of the multiplexer.
       C: out std_logic);--creates the output of the multiplexer
end A7_Mux;

architecture Behavioral of A7_Mux is

begin
  C<= COL(conv_integer(C_SEL));--as the Pi cycles the C_SEL lines from binary 0 thru 36, the C_SEL lines are converted to their integer equivalents.  This integer is used as an index to route the status (above or below FPGA threshold voltage) of the input of the specified channel to the MUX output, C.
